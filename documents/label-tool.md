## 4. [CVAT](https://github.com/opencv/cvat)  (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) [default: http://localhost:8080/dashboard/]

CVAT is completely re-designed and re-implemented version of [Video Annotation Tool from Irvine](http://carlvondrick.com/vatic/), California tool. It is free, online, interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. It is being used by our team to annotate million of objects with different properties. Many UI and UX decisions are based on feedbacks from professional data annotation team.

## 6.[OpenLabeler](https://github.com/kinhong/OpenLabeler) [desktop]

*OpenLabeler* is an open source application for annotating objects. It can generate the PASCAL VOC format XML annotation file for artificial intelligence and deep learning training. A unique aspect of this application is its ability to use inference (with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)) to help improve accuracy and speed up the annotation process.

OpenLabeler is written in [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/)/[OpenJFX](https://openjfx.io/) (version 11.x).
